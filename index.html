                    <h3>Lead Developer at Cove Insurance NZ</h3>
                    <p>
                        Came in to lead a young team of developers and help formalize their engineering practice. This includes introducing UI integration tests, formalizing code review habits and team mentoring.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Key Achievements:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sunsetting of the chatbot channel (which was becoming a maintenance burden while barely making business). This was a gradual process of migrating customer identities and deprecating chatbot features.</li>
                        <li>Simplified the build pipeline by dropping redundant build steps and scripting the manual steps</li>
                        <li>Simplified the app payment worklflow. What used to involve emailing a zip file to our payment vendor has been streamlined into simple API calls.</li>
